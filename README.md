# Libft


## Project Overview

#### libft is the first project in the 42 curriculum, where I implemented various C standard library functions and utilities to understand low-level programming concepts better. This project aims to build a personal C library by writing functions replicating commonly used C standard library functions, such as memory manipulation, string manipulation, and type conversion functions.

## Functions Implemented

#### Memory Management: malloc, free, calloc, etc.
#### String Functions: strlen, strcpy, strdup, strcat, etc.
#### Character Tests: isdigit, isalpha, isalnum, etc.
#### Type Conversions: atoi, itoa, itoa_base, etc.
#### Other Utilities: split, strjoin, strtrim, etc.
